                                <p>7 steps to making your first (or next) passive investment</b>.</p>
                                <h3>1. Get Clear On Your Investment Goals</h3>
                                <p>Do you like real estate as an investment vehicle? When you invest in real estate, every dollar can work for you in more than one way. Your money can:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create cashflow</li>
                                    <li>Create equity growth</li>
                                    <li>Benefit from market appreciation</li>
                                    <li>Benefit from leveraged returns</li>
                                    <li>Benefit from pass through tax benefits</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><b>Do you want to be in a passive role versus an active role?</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Active investing</b>means you are finding, qualifying and closing on the asset and overseeing the business plan. This path is great if you have the time, knowledge, hustle and access to capital.</li>
                                    <li><b>Passive investing</b>can be a powerful strategy to build passive cash flow and long-term wealth AND have your time, freedom and attention to do other things. You can still take advantage of all 5 wealth generators of real estate (see above.)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><b>If you want to be passive, what do you want from your passive investing?</b></p>
                                <ul><li><b>Do you want cash flow, appreciation, or a balanced blend of both?</b>There are investments that offer cash flow NOW, or ~2X equity growth over 5-7 years, with risk profiles LOWER than the stock market.</li></ul>
                                <p><b>Why do you want to invest passively?</b></p>
                                <ul><li>Do you want more time with your family, make your JOB optional, travel more, etc.?</li></ul>
                                <p><b>Do you have capital to invest?</b> Most investments start with a minimum $50K investment.</p>
                                <h3>2. Determine Your Risk Tolerance</h3>
                                <p>In real estate, the business plan for the asset can affect the risk profile of the investment. What asset profiles appeal to you?</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Core</b>: Newer assets with high occupancy in stable urban and suburban markets. Generally no rehabs needed, so you are waiting for natural rental growth. These buildings offer low stabilized returns. Benefit from pass-through tax benefits.</li>
                                    <li><b>Core Plus</b>: Newer assets with high occupancy in stable urban and suburban markets. Generally buildings need a cosmetic rehab, so there is the potential for forced growth through raising rents and adding streams of income. Benefit from pass-through tax benefits.</li>
                                    <li><b>Vlaue Add</b>: Older assets with deferred maintenance and/or operational issues. Great opportunity for forced appreciation through raising rents and occupancy, decreasing expenses, and adding streams of income. Benefit from pass-through tax benefits.</li>
                                    <li><b>Opportunistic</b>: Highly distressed properties ir new development. Highest potential returns with the highest risk. Benefit from pass-through tax benefits. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>3. Find And Vet The Operator</h3>
                                <p>Once you understand your investment goals and risk tolerance, next search for operators and sign up for their Investor Club list. Then hop on a short introductory call and be prepared to discuss the following questions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Do they seem genuine, authentic, transparent, and honest? Do you like them?</li>
                                    <li>What is their background? How many syndications have they done? How many deals have they taken full cycle?</li>
                                    <li>Who is on their team? What is everybody’s role?</li>
                                    <li>Do they have any hands on operational experience? If not, how are they managing the property management company?</li>
                                    <li>What is their typical investment strategy (eg. cash flow, force equity, buy and hold)?</li>
                                    <li>What are the major risks of the investment strategy? (eg. what is the risk profile)?</li>
                                    <li>Ask for references of previous/current investors</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>4. Vet The Markets The Operators Invest In</h3>
                                <p>The next step is to analyze the market where the property is located. Here are some key metrics to look for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Population is increasing</li>
                                    <li>Job growth is increasing</li>
                                    <li>Job diversity is present</li>
                                    <li>Income growth is on the rise</li>
                                    <li>Crime rate is declining</li>
                                    <li>Landlord friendly state</li>
                                    <li>Favorable tax laws</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>5. Review The Investment Summary And Deal Structure</h3>
                                <p>When an operator has a deal open for investment, they will send an Investment Summary and Investor Webinar.</p>
                                <ul><li><b>The Investment Summary</b> is an all-in-one business plan package for the deal. Review the deal assets as soon as they are sent to your inbox. Don’t delay as deals can fill quickly.</li></ul>
                                <h3>6. Plan Your Commitment To Invest</h3>
                                <p>If you are ready to invest, be prepared to move quickly. Some deals can fully subscribe in a matter of hours!</p>
                                <ul><li>This is typically handled via an online form where the operator can collect all of the necessary information to hold your investment spot.</li></ul>
                                <h3>7. Review/Sign The Legal Documents and Wire Your Funds</h3>
                                <p>There are three main legal documents you will need to sign when investing in a passive syndication:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Subscription Agreement</li>
                                    <li>Operating Aggreement</li>
                                    <li>Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>You should read all documents carefully and consult with your legal and tax team. Private Placement Investments are generally illiquid, meaning your money is tied up in the deal for the life of the project.</p>
