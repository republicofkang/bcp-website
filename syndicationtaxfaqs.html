                                <h3><b>FAQs on Real Estate Syndication Tax Benefits</b></h3>
                                <p>You can earn significant passive income through investing in real estate syndication without ever worrying about your tax bill. Here, we address the most common questions from aspiring investors looking at real estate syndication.</p>
                                <h3>How Are Real Estate Syndicates Taxed?</h3>
                                <p>General partners and limited partners in real estate syndications pay taxes differently. This is because general partners get extra fees which are taxed differently to the regular cash flow and sales proceeds. You want to discuss with your tax professional to ensure you’re using the appropriate tax strategies to minimize your tax as much as possible.</p>
                                <p>Typically, general partners get an acquisition fee, ranging from one to three percent of the property’s purchase price for their roles in the syndication. This acquisition is regarded as ordinary income and bears self-employment tax.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, general partners get an asset management fee, ranging from one to three percent of the collected gross rent, which comes under self-employment tax. Sometimes, a real estate syndication charges other fees like construction fees, refinancing fees, or disposition charges. All these fees are subject to self-employment taxation like the asset management and acquisition fees.</p>
                                <p>On the other side of the coin, the general partner’s income is part of the cash flow from the interest on the investment. Depending on the holding period, the proceeds of the sale are taxed as either a short-term capital gain or long-term capital gain. The IRS levies a passive rental income or loss—as applicable—on this income. Lastly, general partners have to pay appreciation recapture tax on depreciation on their investment interest.</p>
                                <p>Limited partners get different fees from general partners since they’re not actively participating in the routine management investment. Their aim of investing is to earn a return on their investment from the cash flow on the investment. So, like with general partners, this income is taxed as a passive rental income or passive income loss.</p>
                                <p>Also, the IRS will tax short-term or long-term capital gains, depending on the holding period of the sales proceeds. Other taxes applicable to limited partners are depreciation recapture (as appropriate) and a share of the income or loss on Form K-1 when filing in the partnership tax return.</p>
                                <h3>Can You 1031 Out of a Syndication?</h3>
                                <p>Yes, you can carry a 1031 Exchange out of a real estate syndication into other investments. Here are the requirements for doing a 1031 exchange according to the US Internal Revenue Code:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The property you’re selling must be an investment property</li>
                                    <li>The investment you’re buying must be of “like-kind”</li>
                                    <li>The purchased property must be at least the same value as the relinquished property or more</li>
                                    <li>Both the person or entity that submitted property and the person buying the new property must be the same</li>
                                    <li>Sales proceeds must be held in an escrow account</li>
                                    <li>The purchased property must be identified within 45 days after closing on the relinquished property.</li>
                                    <li>The purchase must be completed within 180 days of closing on the sold property.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Typically, a 1031 Exchange offers two significant benefits: a preferred return based on a higher investment amount and deferred taxes. Once you’re ready to do a 1031 exchange, you need to consult a 1031 exchange consultant. These consultants are intermediaries who specialize in 1031 exchanges.</p>
                                <p>The company you eventually choose will send you an outline of their 1031 Exchange process and ask you to fill a Form W-9.</p>
                                <p>Alongside filling the Form W-9, the company will require that you provide them with some details such as the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Name and contact information of the person(s) or entity (or who will sign on behalf of) in the title, and the type of entity (whether single-member LLC, partnership, large firm, etc.?)</li>
                                    <li>Copy of the purchase and sale agreement</li>
                                    <li>Address of the property under consideration</li>
                                    <li>Name of the buyer</li>
                                    <li>Tentative closing date</li>
                                    <li>Name and contact information of title company or closing attorney handling the sale.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Your 1031 consultant will roll out your sale proceeds into a new deal and keep you informed on the subsequent obligations and rewards involved.</p>
                                <h3>How Can I Lower My Taxable Income in Real Estate?</h3>
                                <p>Depreciation is the most straightforward way for passive investors to reduce taxable income in the real estate industry. Typically, depreciation is a term that expresses the reduction in the value of a tangible asset such as equipment or a building. As you may already know, wear and tear, age, and usage are the most significant causes of the decrease in any property’s value.</p>
                                <p>There are different ways you could calculate the value of depreciation on your real estate syndication investment. Some calculators are based on the straight-line depreciation method, whereby users will input the number of years or months to depreciate the property.</p>
                                <p>Then there are reducing balance method calculators, a strategic tax planning tool, that’s based on the annual depreciation rate and the initial worth of the asset.</p>
                                <p>Other tools are the annuity, the composite method, and the sum of years’ digits. For instance, the composite method considers factors like the depreciable and historical cost, the useful life of an asset, and the salvage value.</p>
                                <p>The tax office calculates the depreciation expense as accumulated depreciation and deducts it from the gross amount reported on the asset. That’s not all. The amount of accumulated depreciation also increases annually in your tax bill. That means you can enjoy more deductions from your investment gains with time over accumulated depreciation.</p>
