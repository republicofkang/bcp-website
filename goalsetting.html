                                <h3><b>Goal Setting for Real Estate Investors: How to Set Goals to Live the Life You Love</b></h3>
                                <p>Having clearly defined goals is one of the most important steps in achieving investing success. By setting realistic goals and planning your actions, you can live the life you love while building wealth through real estate syndications.</p>
                                <p>It’s a brand new year. Do you have your long-term goals written out already? Maybe it is your year to replace your corporate salary with passive income from real estate investments. Or maybe this is the year you’ll finally achieve financial freedom, choose to stay home with your kids, or finally retire from the rat race. Is it possible this is the year you embrace the financial stability you’ve worked so hard for and live out your dream of traveling the world with your family? </p>
                                <p>In this blog post, we will discuss how to set realistic goals for yourself and find investments that will help you achieve those goals. We’ll also look at the benefits of becoming a real estate investor and how your real estate portfolio can help you reach your cash flow and lifestyle objectives!</p>
                                <h3>Real Estate Investors’ New Year’s Goals in 2022</h3>
                                <p>One of the biggest, most important parts of goal setting generally involves self-reflection. You have to do some quiet inner work to pull your hopes and desires (especially those you previously cast aside because you deemed them impossible or ridiculous) to the surface.</p>
                                <p>The real estate investing journey requires as much personal growth as it has to do with market trends, your risk tolerance, the amount of money you can invest, and how you strategize as an investor, which is why the first step requires you to examine your personal desires before you go off thinking you need an insane amount of capital to make your dreams come true.</p>
                                <h3>Look Inward Before You Look At The Money</h3>
                                <p>First, you have to rediscover your ambitions. Remember those big dreams and goals you had before life beat you down? It’s time to dream again about the achievements, status, financial accomplishments, lifestyle, and freedom that you might have believed were possible when you were young. Revisit the ambitions (small or large) you’d like to work toward. You have the chance to think about what you want in life, and instead of immediately casting those ideas aside as “impossible”, get creative about how you might achieve those goals. </p>
                                <h3>How Can Real Estate Investing Support Your Purpose?</h3>
                                <p>In the second step, you’re going to activate your unique purpose, figuring out exactly where you fit in or stand out and use your differences to your advantage. If you are a person who absolutely loves to upcycle and renovate you may stand out in the house-flipping business. If you are someone who likes to invest and help others make their dreams come true of living in a new apartment or opening their storefront, real estate syndications may be where you fit in! </p>
                                <h3>Figure Out The Cash Flow
                                </h3>
                                <p>Finally, you have to figure out what you want your life to be like. This is the concept behind lifestyle design – you come up with your desired lifestyle and then you start problem-solving so that the results begin to allow the finances, freedom, and feelings you want in your life. </p>
                                <p>How much money do you need to fund the goals you have in mind? It’s in this step where you come up with the desired amount you’d like to earn each month as a passive investor or where you decide which type of real estate makes sense for the returns structure you want.</p>
                                <p>Creating a vision board is a great activity to get you started toward designing your ideal life. You can shape your lifestyle through education, career choice, interests, relationships, events, leisure activities, and investments, and use them to create the style and feelings you want to experience. </p>
                                <h3>Goal Setting For Commercial Real Estate Investors</h3>
                                <p>The rapid planning method is one of the most effective models for goal setting and is very easy to remember. Each letter in the RPM model stands for one of the steps</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>R-Results oriented </li>
                                    <li>P- purpose-driven</li>
                                    <li>M-Massive action plan</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These three steps will help you get from where you are to where you want to go with real estate investing.</p>
                                <h3>The Rapid Planning Method – Results Oriented</h3>
                                <p>First, start by thinking about what you really want. Maybe you dream of traveling more or spending more time with your family, or you may want to venture into entrepreneurship. These are your personal goals. </p>
                                <p>At first, you may not see how these personal goals matter to or affect your real estate investment plan. However, in time, you’ll begin setting up your investments so that they can help shape and support the achievement of your personal goals! </p>
                                <h3>The Rapid Planning Method – Purpose Driven</h3>
                                <p>What is your purpose? </p>
                                <p>100 years from now, what do you want your legacy to look like? Consider whether your children or grandchildren will be able to share about the impact you made on them, the family, the community, etc. Will they have a legacy passed down to them through your investing, companies, or philanthropic efforts? </p>
                                <p>Even if you don’t feel ready to determine your “legacy” just yet, you can still begin to work toward your idea of positive impact, community support, and personal growth. Your aspirations will change as the years pass, and your legacy may unfold as part of that process. </p>
                                <p>Maybe right now your goal is to simply diversify your portfolio by incorporating real estate investments or to help refresh entire communities’ multifamily properties. If so, every real estate syndication investment is adding a notch toward those goals. It is ok to start small and simple and dream bigger as time goes on! </p>
                                <h3>The Rapid Planning Method – Massive Action</h3>
                                <p>Finally, create an action plan in which you decide the exact steps you’ll take to walk toward your goals. Make a list of the things, events, and connections that may help you achieve your goals. </p>
                                <p>Don’t hesitate to include seemingly simple activities like calling your CPA friend for a referral or habits such as drinking more water or hiring a personal trainer. List out anything you could do and the resources you need that would guide you closer to your dreams.</p>
                                <p>If one of your goals is to invest in real estate, without becoming a landlord, we will be happy to explain how syndications work and guide you through the process of investing alongside us.  </p>
                                <p>Using the rapid planning method while creating real estate investing goals for yourself will help you narrow down the types of properties you want to invest in and which investment strategy you want to experience!</p>
                                <h3>Real Estate Syndication Investment Goals</h3>
                                <p>Many people have “investing” as one of their goals, and here at Goodegg, we can help you redefine what investing means to you and help you invest passively in large commercial assets across the US. Real estate investing is what we love to share because it can be such an eye-opening, life-changing opportunity for many people.</p>
                                <p>If you’re wondering how real estate can be the key to reaching your goals, take this projected returns example. </p>
                                <p>In most real estate syndications, you can find through Banana Capital Partners Investor, the hold period is about three to five years, the cash-on-cash return is projected between 5-10%, and the profit at the sale of the property is estimated to be 40-60% of your investment capital value. This means if you invest $100,000, to begin with, you have a chance to end up with $200,000 when it’s all said and done. Pretty sweet deal, since you do not need to really do any work!</p>
                                <p>Remember, these are projections, NOT guarantees. All investments have risks involved and although we wish we could make guarantees, we can not. Each investment opportunity we present has been carefully vetted, and part of that vetting process is ensuring risk-mitigation tactics are in place. This way, we make sure that as you invest alongside us, you can rest easy knowing everything possible is being done to ensure capital preservation and steady returns.</p>
                                <h3>Set Your Goals And Achieve Them With Real Estate Syndications! </h3>
                                <p>No matter how you decide to approach goal setting and working toward the experience you want, approach the process with purpose, be open to the journey, and expect there to be dips and detours along the way! Your mindset has an amazing effect on how hard you work, and whether or not you reach your goals!</p>
                                <p>Whether you have set a goal this year to lose weight, double your household income, or diversify your investment portfolio, the RPM method of goal setting is a great strategy to help you get what you want out of life and enjoy the time you have with those you love the most.</p>
                                <p>Many investors won’t take the time to actually sit down and do this inner work. Most investors try to jump ahead – straight to business plan analysis, vetting property managers, and trying to find the best deal on an investment property. The fact that you’re here and willing to patiently conduct this exercise automatically places you miles ahead of other investors, because, through this process, you gain clarity.</p>
                                <p>When you have clarity around what your investing goals are, it’s easier to identify which asset types or which particular real estate syndication deals might actually move you toward your thoughtful, realistic goal. Simply put, when you set goals you reduce risk.</p>
